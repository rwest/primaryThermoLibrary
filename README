This is a small project to get thermochemistry of CO3 into RMG.

It is based on the paper by Mebel et al. [1].

Geometries from Figure 1 were created in GaussView and saved as Gaussian .gjf
files. 
Cartesian coordinates were put into CanTherm input .dat files, along with 
vibrational frequencies taken from the supplementary material of the paper [1].

The CanTherm output files are then processed by a python script to combine them
into RMG syntax, and to change the H298 values, which are derived from the
relative energies given in the paper [1]. See the source of combine.py for
details.

The .chemgraph files, in RMG syntax, must start with the species name, and end
with a blank line. Only species with a valid chemgraph are included in the
library, others are commented out.

To run the calculations, just type 'make'.
(The makefile must have the correct path to your CanTherm installation,
which is currently assumed to be adjacent to your working directory)

The results end up in Library.txt and Dictionary.txt
